Specialized in mechanical engineering and space systems, I bring a wealth of experience in designing and constructing world-class research infrastructures, instruments and space payloads as well as in mentoring students and aspiring professionals.

I was born in Trento, Italy and have had the opportunity to live and work in France, Switzerland, Germany and USA gaining valuable international experience. As a purpose-driven person, in 2021 I accepted the challenge of returning to Italy with the goal of making an impact to the society that grew me by guiding the Italian payload to the LISA space mission.

With a proven track record of ensuring compliant performance and timely delivery of systems valued at over 150 million EUR, I have contributed to the success of projects with budgets totaling 3.5 billion EUR.
